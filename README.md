Falling World, Global Gamejam J12
============

A game made for the Global Gamejam 2012 in less than 48 hours   
We initially used a mercurial repo, but now migrated to github. That's why commit messages can seem odd.   
The development of this game is halted indefinitely.   
Note that the commit messages are garbage because of the busy nature of the event. :)
